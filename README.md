Hi there! I’m Tara, a Computer Science student at Ontario Tech University specializing in Data Science. I’m diving deep into learning data manipulation, visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning amongst others!

I’m eager to put these skills into practice and am actively seeking opportunities to gain hands-on experience in the data science/analytics field. Whether through internships, collaborative projects, or networking with industry professionals, I’m excited to learn and grow in this dynamic field.

When I’m not immersed in data, I love creating and editing content, which adds a creative flair to my technical pursuits.
